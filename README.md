## Introduction
Hello! Welcome to my maker portfolio.  

Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been fascinated by how things worked—especially **electronics and robotics**. My journey began in **Grade 6**, when I joined my school’s electronics lab and started experimenting with simple circuits. That curiosity quickly grew into building robots and competing in national and international competitions.

## Early Robotics: Lego Differential Drives
My first real exposure to robotics came through **Lego-based differential drive robots**, which I built and competed with in the **RoboCup Rescue Line competition in India**.

### First Iterations
The initial robot was simple:  
- An on/off switch with **two light sensors** to follow a line.  

### Competition Requirements
The task expected us to design a robot that could:  
- Follow a black line on a white surface.  
- Avoid obstacles and climb ramps.  
- Navigate hurdles.  
- Rescue victims (plastic balls) and deposit them in the designated zone.

### Progression
Over time, I learned about **control loops** and applied **PID controllers** to make the robot more reliable.  
- Our final Lego robot placed **2nd nationally**.  
- We received the **Best Technical Skills Award**.  
- We qualified for the **Asia-Pacific RoboCup in Moscow**.

## Transition to Open Source: Arduino Robots
By **Grade 11**, we realized Lego systems were limiting. We transitioned to **Arduino-based designs** with custom electronics and mechanics.

### Design Highlights
- **3D-printed chassis** with a 4-wheeled differential drive.  
- **PID control** for smooth and precise line following.  
- **7 IR sensors** to detect line position.  
- **Color sensors** to identify green rescue markers.  
- **Ultrasonic sensors** for obstacle and hurdle detection.  
- **Dual microcontrollers**: Arduino Mega (main logic) + Arduino Nano (sensor handling).  
- Retained **Lego motors** for the lifting mechanism due to their torque.  

### Rescue System
We designed a **basket with tactile switches** that:  
- Detected when the robot entered the rescue zone.  
- Controlled motor rotations to drop victims with precision.

## High School Combat Robotics
In addition to rescue robots, I also explored **combat robotics** during high school.

### Achievements
- Designed and built wedge-based combat robots.  
- Won multiple **high school and university-level competitions**.  
- Secured **1st place at Technoxian**, one of India’s biggest war robotics competitions.
